            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Sunrise Solar Solutions was founded in 2010 by a group of engineers and environmental enthusiasts with a
                shared vision: to harness the sun's power and make renewable energy accessible for everyone. Initially,
                the company focused on providing solar panel installation services for residential homes. Over the
                years, we expanded into commercial sectors, offering customized solar energy solutions for businesses,
                schools, and government buildings.
            </p>
            <p>Our commitment to innovation and sustainability has driven our steady growth. In 2015, we introduced our
                own line of solar panels, designed for maximum efficiency in various climates. Today, we operate in over
                30 states and serve over 50,000 customers. Our future goal is to help homeowners and businesses achieve
                energy independence while contributing to a cleaner, greener planet.
